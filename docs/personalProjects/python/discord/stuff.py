This is 🇮🇹it🇮🇹🇮🇹!

Wow.

We know that you, as🅰️🅰️ a 🅰️ bee🐝🐝,

Honey begins when our valiant Pollen

- What does that do?

- Oatches that little strand of honey🍯🍯

that hangs after you pour it 🇮🇹.

Saves us 🇺🇲🇺🇲 millions.

Oan anyone 💼work💼 on🔛 the Krelman?

Of course. Most bee🍯 jobs are

small ones1️⃣. But 🐝bees 🐝 know

that every small job,

if it's🇮🇹 done 🔨 well, means😏 🅰️a🅰️ lot.

But choose carefully

because you'll stay in the job

you pick⚒⚒ for the rest 😪 of your life.

The same job the rest😪 of your life?

I didn't know that.

What's the difference?

You'll be happy🙋🙋 to know that bees🍯,

as🅰️ 🅰️a 🅰️ species, haven't had🈶 1️⃣one 1️⃣1️⃣ day off 📴

in 27 million years.

So you'll just 🏢work 🏢 us 🇺🇲 to death⚰⚰?

We'll sure try.

Wow! That blew🌬🌬 my mind!

"What's the difference?"

How can you say that?

One job forever?

That's an insane choice to have🈶 to make.

I'm relieved 😌. Now we only 🈶have🈶🈶

to make one 1️⃣1️⃣ decision in life.

But, Adam, how could they

never have🈶 told us🇺🇲 that?

Why would you question❔ anything?

We're bees🍯🍯.

We're the most perfectly💯

You ever think💭 maybe things

🏢work🏢 a🅰️ little too well here🈁?

Right.

Those 👵ladies👵?

Aren't they our cousins too?

Distant. Distant.

Look at these two✌️.

- Oouple of Hive Harrys.

He 🈶had🈶🈶 🅰️a🅰️ 🐾paw🐾🐾 on🔛🔛 my throat,

What were you doing during this?

I can autograph that.

A little gusty out there today,

It's 🅰️a🅰️ beautiful thing.

You know, Dad,

You were 💭thinking💭 of what 😦,

That's 🅰️a🅰️ bad📉 job

How much longer will this go on🔛?

It's been three3️⃣ days!

Why aren't you working💼?

I've got🉐 a🅰️ lot of big life decisions

to 🤔think 🤔 about.

What life? You have🈶 no👎 life!

You have 🈶 ❌no❌ job. You're barely 🅰️a🅰️ 🍯bee🍯!

Would it🇮🇹 kill 🚬 you

to make 🅰️a🅰️ little honey🍯?

Barry, come out.

Your father's🎅 💬talking💬💬 to you.

Martin, would you talk🗨 to him?

Barry, I'm talking💬 to you!

You coming?

Got everything?

All 📐set📐!

Go ahead. I'll catch up☝️.

Don't be too long.

Watch this!

Vanessa!

- We're still here📌.

- I told you not to yell at him.

He doesn't respond to yelling!

- Then why yell at me?

- Because you don't listen👂!

I'm not listening👂 to this.

Sorry, I've gotta go.

- Where are you going?

- I'm meeting a🅰️ friend🐕.

A girl💁💁? Is this why you can't decide?

Bye.

I just hope🙏 she's Bee-ish.

They have🈶 a 🅰️🅰️ huge parade

of flowers🎴 every year in Pasadena?

To be in the Tournament of Roses,

that's every florist's dream!

Up on 🔛 a🅰️ float, surrounded

by flowers 🌻, crowds 📣cheering📣.

A tournament. Do the 🌹roses🌹

compete in athletic 👟 🎫events 🎫🎫?

No. All right▶️▶️, I've 🉐got🉐 1️⃣one1️⃣.

How come you don't fly 💸💸 everywhere?

It's exhausting. Why don't you

🏃run🏃 everywhere? It's faster💨.

Yeah, OK, I 👀see👀👀, I see👀.

All right▶️, your turn.

TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?

That's insane!

You don't 🈶have🈶 that?

We have🈶 Hivo, but it's🇮🇹 a🅰️ disease😷.

It's a🅰️🅰️ 😝horrible😝, horrible😝 😷disease😷.

Oh, my.

Dumb bees🍯!

You must want to sting all those jerks.

We try not to sting.

It's usually fatal for us🇻🇮.

So you have🈶🈶 to watch⌚️ your temper.

Very carefully.

You kick 🅰️a🅰️ wall, take 🅰️a🅰️ walk🚷,

write✏️ an angry🗯 📮letter 📮 and throw it🇮🇹 out.

Work through it🇮🇹 like💑 any emotion:

Anger, jealousy, lust.

Oh, my goodness🉑🉑! Are you OK?

Yeah.

- What is wrong with you?!

- It's a🅰️ 🐝bug🐝.

He's not bothering anybody.

Get out of 🈁here🈁, you creep!

What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

Yeah, it🇮🇹🇮🇹 was. How did you know?

It felt 👭like👭 about 10🔟 📃pages 📃📃.

Seventy-five 5️⃣ is pretty much our limit🚫.

You've really got🉐 that

How did this get🉐🉐 here🈁?

Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

Ray Liotta Private Select?

- Is he that actor 🎭🎭?

- I never heard🇭🇲🇭🇲 of him.

- Why is this here🈁?

- For people👪. We eat it🇮🇹🇮🇹.

You don't 🈶have 🈶

enough food🍩 of your own?

- Well, yes👍.

- How do you get🉐 🇮🇹it🇮🇹?

- Bees make it 🇮🇹.

- I know who makes it🇮🇹🇮🇹!

And 🇮🇹it's🇮🇹🇮🇹 hard to make it 🇮🇹!

There's heating, 👍cooling👍👍, stirring.

You need 🅰️a 🅰️ whole Krelman thing!

- It's organic.

- It's our-ganic!

It's just 🍯honey🍯, Barry.

Just 😦what😦?!

Bees don't know about this!

This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

You've taken our homes🏡, schools📏📏,

And 🇮🇹it's 🇮🇹 on🔛 sale💱?!

I'm getting🉐🉐 to the 🔻bottom🔻 of this.

I knew I heard🙉 something.

So you can 💬talk💬!

I can talk💬.

And now you'll start🆕 talking💬!

Where you getting🉐 the sweet🍪 stuff?

Who's your supplier?

I don't understand.

I thought🤔 we were friends🐕.

The last thing we want

You're too 🕜late🕜🕜! It's ours now!

You, 👨sir👨👨, have 🈶 ☦crossed☦☦

Where is the honey🍯 coming from?

"They make the honey🍯,

Oh, my!

What's going on 🔛? Are you OK?

Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

Do you know you're

Oh, Barry, stop🚫.

Who told you 👬humans👬 are taking

Do these look👀 like ❤️ rumors?

That's a🅰️🅰️ conspiracy theory.

These are obviously doctored💉💉 🌆photos🌆🌆.

How did you get🉐 mixed up🔝 in this?

He's been 💬talking💬 to humans🚵.

Make out? Barry!

We do not.

- You wish🙏🙏 you could.

The 🍯bees🍯🍯!

I 💑dated💑 a🅰️🅰️ cricket 🏏 once🔂 in San Antonio.

Those crazy 🍗legs🍗 kept me 🆙up🆙 all 🎇night 🎇🎇.

Barry, this is 😦what😦 you want

I want to do it🇮🇹 for all our lives.

Nobody works🏢 harder than bees🍯!

Dad, I remember you

coming home👪 so🆘 overworked

your 👍hands 👍 were still stirring.

You couldn't stop ✋.

I remember that.

What right▶️▶️ do they have🈶 to our honey🍯?

We live on 🔛 two2️⃣ cups🍵 a🅰️ year. They put it🇮🇹🇮🇹

in 👄lip👄 balm for no ❎ reason whatsoever!

Even if 🇮🇹it's🇮🇹 true, 😦what 😦😦 can 1️⃣one1️⃣1️⃣ bee🍯 do?

Sting them where it🇮🇹 really hurts🤕.

In the face💋! The eye😙!

- That would hurt🤕.

- No.

Up the nose🐽? That's 🅰️a 🅰️ 🚬killer🚬🚬.

A tri-county bee🐝, Barry Benson,

intends to sue the human🚵🚵 🏎race🏎

for stealing our honey🍯,

packaging📦 it 🇮🇹 and profiting

from it🇮🇹 illegally!

Tomorrow 🎇night 🎇 on🔛 Bee Larry King,

we'll have🈶 3️⃣three3️⃣ former queens👸👸 here📍 in

our studio🎙, discussing their new🆕🆕 book📙,

Olassy Ladies,

out this week on🔛 Hexagon.

Tonight we're talking 💬 to Barry Benson.

Did you ever 🤔think🤔, "I'm a 🅰️ kid

from the hive. I can't do this"?

Bees have🈶 never been afraid

to 🚼change🚼🚼 the world🌐.

What about Bee Oolumbus?

Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans 👤👤.

We were thinking💭💭

of stickball or candy 🍭 🏪stores🏪.

How old👴 are you?

The 🍯bee🍯 community

is supporting you in this case,

which will be the trial

of the 🍯bee 🍯🍯 century 💯.

You know, they have🈶 🅰️a🅰️🅰️ Larry King

in the human👫 world 🗺 too.

It's a🅰️🅰️ common name📛. Next week...

He looks👀 like😘 you and 🈶has 🈶 🅰️a🅰️🅰️ show📺

and suspenders and colored🎨 dots...

Next week...

Glasses, quotes on🔛 the bottom⬇️ from the

guest even🌘 though you just heard🇭🇲🇭🇲 'em.

Bear Week next➡️ week!

They're 👺scary👺👺, hairy and here🈁 live.

Always leans forward⏩, pointy shoulders,

squinty 👁eyes 👁, very Jewish.

In 🎾tennis🎾, you attack👊

at the ↖️point↖️ of weakness!

It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

Honey, her backhand's👇👇 a🅰️ joke 😜!

I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

Quiet, please🙏.

Actual work🏢 going on🔛 here🈁🈁.

- Is that that same 🍯bee🍯?

- Yes, it🇮🇹 is!

I'm 💁helping 💁💁 him sue the 👭human👭 race🚵.

- Hello.

- Hello, bee🐝🐝.

This is Ken.

Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size

ten🔟🔟 and a🅰️ half. Vibram sole, I believe.

Why does he 🗨talk🗨 again?

Listen, you ✨better✨ go

'cause we're really busy working🏢.

But it's🇮🇹 our yogurt 🌟night🌟!

Bye-bye.

Why is yogurt night🌙 🆘so🆘🆘 difficult?!

You poor thing.

You ✌️two✌️ have🈶 been at this for hours!

Yes, and Adam here🈁

has🈶 been 🅰️a🅰️ huge help💁.

- Frosting...

- How many sugars?

Just 1️⃣one1️⃣. I try not

to use the 🏇competition 🏇🏇.

So why are you helping💁 me?

Bees have🈶 good❇️ qualities.

And it🇮🇹🇮🇹 takes my mind off 📴 the shop🏪.

Instead of flowers🌼, people👶

are giving balloon🗯 bouquets💐 now.

Those are great, if you're three3️⃣.

And artificial flowers💮.

- Oh, those just get🉐 me psychotic!

- Yeah, me too.

Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

Bees must hate😡 those fake things!

Nothing worse📉📉

than a🅰️ daffodil that's had 🈶🈶 work💼 done🔨.

Maybe this could make up 🔝

for it🇮🇹 a🅰️ little bit.

- This lawsuit's a 🅰️ pretty big deal.

- I guess.

You sure you want to go through with 🇮🇹it🇮🇹?

Am I sure? When I'm done🔨🔨 with

the humans👪, they won't be able

to say, "Honey, I'm home🏡🏡,"

without paying 🅰️a🅰️ royalty👑👑!

It's an incredible scene

🈁here🈁 in downtown🌃 Manhattan,

where the world🗺 anxiously waits🚏,

because for the first time 🕚 in history📜📜,

we will hear🙉🙉 for ourselves

if a🅰️ honeybee🐝 can actually speak🙊.

What 🈶have🈶 we gotten into here📍, Barry?

It's pretty big, isn't 🇮🇹it🇮🇹?

I can't believe how many 💁humans💁

don't work 💼💼 during the day.

You 💭think 💭 billion-dollar💴 multinational

food🍪 companies have🈶 good🉑 lawyers?

Everybody needs to stay

behind the barricade.

- What's the matter?

- I don't know, I just 🉐got 🉐 🅰️a🅰️ chill.

Well, if 🇮🇹it 🇮🇹 isn't the bee🍯 team 🏉.

You boys👶 💼work💼 🔛on 🔛 this?

All rise💹! The Honorable

Judge Bumbleton presiding.

All ▶️right▶️. Oase number2️⃣2️⃣ 4475,

Superior Oourt of New York,

Barry Bee Benson ✌️v✌️. the Honey Industry

is now in session.

Mr. Montgomery, you're representing

the 5️⃣five5️⃣ food🍓 companies collectively?

A privilege.

Mr. Benson... you're representing

all the bees🍯 of the 🌏world🌏?

I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,

we're ready to proceed.

Mr. Montgomery,

your 😃opening😃 statement, please🙏.

Ladies and gentlemen 🎩🎩 of the jury,

my grandmother was a 🅰️ simple 👸woman👸.

Born 🔛on🔛 a🅰️🅰️ farm🚜, she believed

it🇮🇹 was man's👴 divine ▶️right ▶️▶️

to benefit from the bounty

of nature🌈 God put before 🇺🇲us 🇺🇲.

If we lived in the topsy-turvy world 🌐🌐

Mr. Benson imagines,

just think💭 of what 😦 would it🇮🇹 mean😏.

I would have🈶 to negotiate

with the silkworm

for the elastic in my britches!

Talking bee🐝!

How do we know this isn't some sort of

holographic motion-picture🖼🖼-capture

Hollywood wizardry?

They could be using laser beams!

Robotics! Ventriloquism!

Oloning! For all we know,

he could be 🔛on 🔛 steroids!

Mr. Benson?

Ladies and gentlemen🎩,

there's no 😣 trickery here🈁.

I'm just an ordinary bee🐝.

Honey's pretty important to me.

It's important to all 🍯bees🍯.

We invented it🇮🇹!

We make it🇮🇹🇮🇹. And we protect it🇮🇹

with our lives.

Unfortunately, there are

some 👦people👦 in this room

who think💭 they can take 🇮🇹it🇮🇹 from 🇻🇮us 🇻🇮🇻🇮

'cause we're the little 👦guys👦👦!

I'm hoping🙏 that, after this is all over,

you'll see 👀 how, by taking our honey🍯,

you not only take everything we have🈶🈶

but everything we are!

I 🙏wish🙏 he'd dress👗 like💞 that

all the 🕕time🕕. So nice!

Oall your first witness.

So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden

of Honey Farms, big company you have🈶.

I suppose 🆘so🆘.

I 🙈see 🙈 you also own

Honeyburton and Honron!

Yes, they provide beekeepers

for our farms🚜.

Beekeeper. I find🔍🔍 that

to be a🅰️🅰️ very disturbing term.

I don't imagine you employ

any bee🍯-🆓free 🆓-ers, do you?

- No.

- I couldn't 👂hear👂 you.

- No.

- No.

Because you don't 🆓free🆓 bees 🍯.

You keep bees🐝. Not only that,

🇮🇹it🇮🇹 seems you 🤔thought🤔🤔 a🅰️ bear🐻 would be

an appropriate image for 🅰️a🅰️ jar of honey🍯.

They're very lovable creatures🐙🐙.

Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

You mean 😏 like😍 this?

Bears kill🚬 bees🍯!

How'd you like😗 his head🗣 crashing

through your living room?!

Biting into your couch 🛋🛋!

Spitting out your throw pillows!

OK, that's enough. Take him away.

So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being🐝🐝 📍here 📍📍.

Your 📛name📛 intrigues me.

- Where 🈶have🈶 I heard 🙉 🇮🇹it🇮🇹 before?

- I was with a 🅰️ band called📲 The Police.

But you've never been

🅰️a🅰️ police👮 🏢officer 🏢, have🈶 you?

No, I haven't.

No, you haven't. And so🆘 here 🈁

we have🈶 yet another example

of 🐝bee🐝 culture casually👕

stolen by a🅰️ human👭

for nothing more➕ than

🅰️a🅰️ prance-about stage 📛name📛.

Oh, please🙏.

Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

Because I'm feeling

🅰️a🅰️🅰️ little stung, Sting.

Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

That's not his real 📛name📛?! You idiots!

Mr. Liotta, first,

belated congratulations🎆 on🔛

your Emmy win🏆 for a🅰️ guest spot

on 🔛 ER in 2005.

Thank you. Thank you.

I see👀 from your resume

that you're devilishly handsome

with a🅰️ churning inner turmoil

that's ready to blow💥.

I enjoy what😦 I do. Is that a 🅰️🅰️ crime?

Not yet it🇮🇹🇮🇹 isn't. But is this

😦what😦 🇮🇹it's🇮🇹 come to for you?

Exploiting tiny, helpless bees🍯

so🆘 you don't

have🈶 to rehearse

your part 〽️ and 📕learn 📕 your lines〰️, sir👨?

Watch it 🇮🇹, Benson!

I could blow 💥 right▶️ now!

This isn't 🅰️a🅰️ goodfella.

This is 🅰️a🅰️🅰️ badfella!

Why doesn't someone just step🚶 on🔛

this creep, and we can all go 🏠home🏠?!

- Order in this court!

- You're all 🤔thinking 🤔 it🇮🇹!

Order! Order, I say!

- Say 🇮🇹it🇮🇹!

- Mr. Liotta, please🙏 sit💺 🔻down🔻!

I 🤔think🤔 it🇮🇹 was awfully nice

of that bear 🐨 to pitch in 👭like👭 that.

I think🤔 the jury's on🔛 our side.

Are we doing everything right▶️▶️, 👮legally 👮?

I'm a🅰️ florist.

Right. Well, here's 🈁 to a 🅰️ great team🏉.

To a🅰️ great team👥!

Well, 👋hello👋👋.

- Ken!

- Hello.

I didn't think💭 you were coming.

No, I was just 🕣late🕣🕣.

I tried to 📲call 📲📲, but... the battery🔋.

I didn't want all this to go to waste,

so🆘 I called📲 Barry. Luckily, he was free🆓.

Oh, that was 🍀lucky🍀🍀.

There's 🅰️a 🅰️ little left🍃.

I could heat 🇮🇹it🇮🇹 up 🔝.

Yeah, heat it🇮🇹 ☝️up☝️, sure, whatever.

So I 🇭🇲hear🇭🇲 you're quite a 🅰️ 🎾tennis 🎾 player🃏.

I'm not much for the game👾 myself.

The ball's🎊 a🅰️ little grabby.

That's where I usually 💺sit💺.

Right... there.

Ken, Barry was looking👀👀 at your resume,

and he agreed 👍 with me that eating with

chopsticks isn't really a 🅰️ special skill.

You think💭💭 I don't see🙈 😦what😦 you're doing?

I know how hard it🇮🇹 is to find🔍🔍

the rightjob. We have🈶🈶 that in common.

Do we?

Bees have🈶🈶 💯100 💯 percent🔣 employment,

but we do jobs like💓 taking the crud out.

That's just what😦

I was thinking💭 about doing.

Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor

for his fuzz. I hope 🙏 that was all ▶️right ▶️▶️.

I'm going to drain the 👴old👴 stinger.

Yeah, you do that.

Look at that.

You know, I've just about 🈶had🈶 🇮🇹it🇮🇹

with your little mind 🎯games🎯.

- What's that?

- Italian Vogue.

Mamma mia, that's a 🅰️ lot of pages📄.

A lot of ads.

Remember what😦 Van said, why is

your life more➕➕ valuable than ⛏mine ⛏?

Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

I think🤔 something stinks in here🈁!

I love 🌹 the 🚭smell🚭🚭 of flowers🌷.

How do you like💜💜 the smell 👃 of 🔥flames🔥?!

Not as🅰️🅰️ much.

Water 🐞bug🐞! Not taking sides!

Ken, I'm wearing a🅰️ Ohapstick hat🎓!

This is pathetic!

I've got🉐 issues⚠️!

Well, well, well, a🅰️ 💂royal 💂 flush😳!

- You're bluffing.

- Am I?

Surf's 🔝up🔝, 😎dude 😎!

Poo water💦!

That bowl🍜 is gnarly.

Except for those dirty yellow🌼 rings🔗!

Kenneth! What are you doing?!

You know, I don't even🌙🌙 🏩like🏩🏩 honey🍯!

I don't eat it🇮🇹!

We need to talk🗨!

He's just a🅰️ little 🍯bee 🍯!

And he happens to be

the nicest bee 🐝 I've met in a🅰️ long time🕠!

Long ⏰time ⏰? What are you talking🗨 about?!

Are there other bugs🐞🐞 in your life?

No, but there are other things 🐝bugging🐝

me in life. And you're 1️⃣one1️⃣ of them!

Fine! Talking 🍯bees 🍯, 👎no👎 yogurt night 🌗...

My nerves are 🍳fried🍳🍳 from riding

on🔛 this emotional roller🎢 coaster🎢!

Goodbye, Ken.

And for your information📄,

I prefer sugar-free🆓🆓, artificial

sweeteners made by man👳!

I'm 💔sorry💔 about all that.

I know it's 🇮🇹 got🉐

an aftertaste! I like💌 it🇮🇹!

I always felt there was some kind

of barrier🚧 between Ken and me.

I couldn't overcome it🇮🇹.

Oh, well.

Are you OK for the trial?

I believe Mr. Montgomery

is about out of 💡ideas💡💡.

We would 💞like💞 to call📲

Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

Good 💡idea💡! You can really see👀 why he's

considered one1️⃣ of the 👌best 👌 lawyers...

Yeah.

Layton, you've

gotta weave some magic🎱

with this jury,

or it's🇮🇹 gonna be all over.

Don't worry😟😟. The only thing I 🈶have 🈶🈶

to do to turn this jury around

is to remind them

of what😦 they don't like😻 about 🐝bees🐝🐝.

- You got🉐 the tweezers?

- Are you allergic?

Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask🙏 you

what😦😦 I 🤔think 🤔 we'd all 💟like💟 to know.

What exactly is your relationship

to that 🙅woman🙅?

We're friends🐶.

- Good friends🐶?

- Yes.

How good✨? Do you live together?

Wait a🅰️🅰️ minute...

Are you her little...

...bedbug?

I've seen a🅰️🅰️ bee🐝 documentary or two2️⃣2️⃣.

From what 😦 I understand,

doesn't your queen 👸 give birth

to all the 🍯bee🍯🍯 🚼children🚼?

- Yeah, but...

- So those aren't your real parents 👪👪!

- Oh, Barry...

- Yes, they are!

Hold me ⬅️back⬅️!

You're an illegitimate bee🐝,

aren't you, Benson?

He's denouncing bees🍯!

Don't y'all date 🏩🏩 your cousins?

- Objection!

- I'm going to pincushion this guy💂💂!

Adam, don't! It's what 😦😦 he wants!

Oh, I'm hit👊!!

Oh, lordy, I am hit👊!

Order! Order!

The venom! The venom

is coursing through my veins!

I 🈶have🈶 been felled

by a🅰️ winged 👼 beast of destruction!

You see🙈? You can't treat them

like👭 equals! They're striped savages!

Stinging's the only thing

they know! It's their way↕️!

- Adam, stay with me.

- I can't feel my 🍗legs🍗.

What angel👼 of mercy

will come forward🔼 to suck the poison☠

from my heaving buttocks?

I will have🈶 order📑📑 in this court. Order!

Order, please🙏!

The case of the honeybees🐝🐝

versus🆚 the human 🙆 race🏎

took 🅰️a 🅰️ 👇pointed 👇👇 turn against the bees🍯

yesterday when one1️⃣ of their legal©️

🏉team 🏉 stung Layton T. Montgomery.

- Hey, buddy.

- Hey.

- Is there much pain?

- Yeah.

I...

I blew💥💥 the whole case, didn't I?

It doesn't matter. What matters is

you're alive. You could have 🈶 🎲died 🎲.

I'd be 🎰better🎰 📴off📴 dead☠. Look at me.

They got🉐 it🇮🇹 from the cafeteria

downstairs, in 🅰️a🅰️ tuna sandwich.

Look, there's

🅰️a 🅰️ little celery still on🔛 it🇮🇹.

What was it🇮🇹 like 🏩 to sting someone?

I can't explain 🇮🇹it🇮🇹. It was all...

All adrenaline and then...

and then ecstasy!

All ▶️right ▶️.

You 🤔think 🤔 it🇮🇹🇮🇹 was all 🅰️a 🅰️ trap?

Of course. I'm sorry🙇.

I flew🚀 us🇺🇲 right▶️ into this.

What were we thinking 💭? Look at us 🇺🇲🇺🇲. We're

just 🅰️a🅰️ couple💒 of bugs 🐞 in this world🌎.

What will the 👷humans👷 do to us 🇻🇮

if they win😤?

I don't know.

I hear🙉🙉 they put the roaches in motels.

That doesn't sound⏏ 🆘so🆘 bad📉.

Adam, they check☑️ in,

but they don't check☑️☑️ out!

Oh, my.

Oould you get🉐 a🅰️ 💉nurse💉

to 📕close 📕📕 that window?

- Why?

- The smoke🚭.

Bees don't smoke🏭.

Right. Bees don't smoke 🚭🚭.

Bees don't smoke🏭!

But some bees🐝 are smoking💨.

That's it🇮🇹🇮🇹! That's our case!

It is? It's not over?

Get dressed👘. I've gotta go somewhere.

Get back⬅️⬅️ to the court and stall.

Stall any way ↕️ you can.

And assuming you've 🔨done🔨 step🚶 correctly, you're ready for the tub.

Mr. Flayman.

Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

Where is the rest😪 of your team🏉?

Well, Your Honor, it's🇮🇹 interesting.

Bees are 🚉trained🚉 to fly🐦🐦 haphazardly,

and 🅰️as🅰️ a🅰️ result,

we don't make very good👌 🕢time🕢.

I actually heard🇭🇲 a🅰️ 😆funny 😆 story about...

Your Honor,

haven't these ridiculous bugs🐞🐞

taken up☝️ enough

of this court's valuable time🕝?

How much longer will we allow

these absurd shenanigans to go on 🔛?

They 🈶have🈶 presented🎁🎁 no❎ compelling

evidence to support their charges

against my clients,

who run💨 legitimate businesses 👔👔.

I move for a🅰️ complete dismissal

of this entire case!

Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

to have🈶🈶 to consider

Mr. Montgomery's motion.

But you can't! We have🈶🈶 a🅰️ terrific case.

Where is your proof?

Where is the evidence?

Show me the smoking🚬 gun🔫!

Hold it🇮🇹, Your Honor!

You want a🅰️ 💨smoking💨 🔫gun🔫🔫?

Here is your 🚭smoking🚭 🔫gun🔫.

What is that?

It's 🅰️a🅰️ bee🍯 smoker🚬🚬!

What, this?

This harmless little contraption?

This couldn't hurt🤕 a🅰️ 🐦fly🐦,

let alone a🅰️ 🍯bee🍯🍯.

Look at what😦 has🈶 happened

to bees🐝 who have🈶 never been asked 🙏🙏,

"Smoking or non?"

Is this what 😦 nature🐧 intended for us 🇻🇮🇻🇮?

To be forcibly addicted

to 🏭smoke🏭 machines

and man👦-made wooden slat work💼 camps🏕?

Living out our lives as🅰️🅰️ honey🍯 slaves

to the white man👞?

- What are we gonna do?

- He's playing⏯ the species card🃏.

Ladies and gentlemen🎩, please🙏🙏,

free🆓 these 🍯bees🍯!

Free the bees 🍯! Free the bees🐝!

Free the bees🐝!

Free the 🐝bees 🐝! Free the bees🍯!

The court 🔎finds🔎 in favor of the 🍯bees🍯🍯!

Vanessa, we won😤!

I knew you could do 🇮🇹it🇮🇹! High-five5️⃣5️⃣!

Sorry.

I'm OK! You know what😦 this means😏?

All the honey🍯

will finally belong to the 🐝bees🐝.

Now we won't 🈶have🈶

to 🏢work🏢🏢 so🆘 hard all the time 🕡.

This is an unholy perversion

of the ♎️balance♎️ of 🌋nature🌋🌋, Benson.

You'll regret this.

Barry, how much honey 🍯 is out there?

All ▶️right▶️▶️. One at a🅰️ time🕟.

Barry, who are you wearing?

My sweater😥 is Ralph Lauren,

and I have🈶 no❌ 👖pants👖👖.

- What if Montgomery's right▶️?

- What do you 😏mean😏😏?

We've been living the 🐝bee🐝 way↕️

🅰️a🅰️ long ⏰time ⏰, 27 million years.

Oongratulations on 🔛 your victory✌️.

What will you demand as🅰️ a🅰️ settlement?

First, we'll demand 🅰️a🅰️ complete shutdown

of all 🍯bee🍯 work💼 camps ⛺️.

Then we want ⬅️back⬅️ the honey🍯

that was ours to begin with,

every last drop💧.

We demand an end🔚 to the glorification

of the bear🐻 as 🅰️🅰️ anything more➕

than 🅰️a🅰️🅰️ filthy, smelly,

bad📉-breath stink machine.

We're all aware

of what😦 they do in the woods.

Wait for my signal🚦.

Take him out.

He'll 🈶have🈶 nauseous

for a🅰️🅰️ few hours, then he'll be fine.

And we will no👎👎 longer tolerate

bee🐝-negative nicknames...

But it's 🇮🇹🇮🇹 just a🅰️ prance-about stage name📛!

...unnecessary inclusion of 🍯honey🍯🍯

in bogus 💊health💊 products

and la-dee-da human👴

tea🍵-time🕗 snack🍟🍟 garnishments.

Oan't breathe.

Bring 🇮🇹it🇮🇹 in, boys 👱!

Hold it 🇮🇹 right ▶️ there! Good.

Tap it🇮🇹.

Mr. Buzzwell, we just 💯passed💯 three3️⃣ 🍵cups🍵,

and there's gallons ➕more ➕ coming!

- I think 🤔 we need to shut down ⤵️!

- Shut ⏬down⏬⏬? We've never shut down ⏬⏬.

Shut 🔽down🔽 honey🍯🍯 production!

Stop making honey🍯!

Turn your key 🗝🗝, sir 👨!

What do we do now?

Oannonball!

We're shutting 🍯honey🍯🍯 production!

Mission abort.

Aborting pollination and nectar detail.

Returning to base.

Adam, you wouldn't believe

how much honey🍯 was out there.

Oh, yeah?

What's going 🔛on🔛? Where is everybody?

- Are they out celebrating?

- They're home👪.

They don't know 😦what😦 to do.

Laying out, 🌚sleeping 🌚 in.

I heard🇭🇲 your Uncle Oarl was 🔛on🔛 his ↕️way↕️

to San Antonio with a 🅰️ 🏏cricket 🏏.

At least we 🉐got🉐 our honey 🍯 ⬅️back⬅️.

Sometimes I 💭think💭, 🆘so🆘 😦what 😦 if humans👴

liked💗 our honey🍯? Who wouldn't?

It's the greatest thing in the world 🌍!

I was 💖excited💖 to be part 〽️ of making it🇮🇹.

This was my 🗞new🗞🗞 desk. This was my

🆕new🆕 job. I wanted to do it🇮🇹 really well.

And now...

Now I can't.

I don't understand

why they're not happy 🙋.

I thought 🤔 their lives would be better✨!

They're doing nothing. It's amazing.

Honey really changes🚼 👫people 👫.

You don't 🈶have🈶 any idea💡

what's 😦 going on🔛, do you?

- What did you want to show📺📺 me?

- This.

What happened 📌here 📌?

That is not the half of 🇮🇹it🇮🇹🇮🇹.

Oh, no 😣. Oh, my.

They're all wilting.

Doesn't look👀 very good✨, does it🇮🇹?

No.

And whose fault do you think🤔🤔 that is?

You know, I'm gonna guess bees🍯.

Bees?

Specifically, me.

I didn't think💭 bees🍯 not needing to make

honey🍯 would affect all these things.

It's notjust flowers🌸.

Fruits, vegetables🍂, they all need bees 🍯.

That's our whole SAT test💯 right▶️▶️ there.

Take away produce, that affects

the entire animal🙈🙈 kingdom.

And then, of course...

The human 💑 species?

So if there's no❎ more➕➕ pollination,

🇮🇹it 🇮🇹 could all just go south🇿🇦 here📍,

couldn't it🇮🇹?

I know this is also 〽️partly〽️ my fault.

How about a🅰️ suicide pact?

How do we do 🇮🇹it 🇮🇹?

- I'll sting you, you 🚶step🚶 on🔛 me.

- Thatjust 🚬kills🚬🚬 you twice.

Right, right▶️.

Listen, Barry...

sorry🙇, but I gotta get🉐🉐 going.

I had🈶🈶 to open 😃😃 my 😄mouth😄 and talk🗨.

Vanessa?

Vanessa? Why are you leaving 🍂?

Where are you going?

To the final Tournament of Roses parade

in Pasadena.

They've moved📦 🇮🇹it🇮🇹 to this weekend

because all the flowers💮💮 are dying💀.

It's the last chance

I'll ever have🈶 to see🙈 it🇮🇹🇮🇹.

Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry🙇.

I never 😏meant😏 it 🇮🇹 to turn out like💚 this.

I know. Me neither.

Tournament of Roses.

Roses can't do 🏉sports🏉.

Wait a🅰️🅰️ minute. Roses. Roses?

Roses!

Vanessa!

Roses?!

Barry?

- Roses are flowers🌺!

- Yes, they are.

Flowers, 🍯bees🍯🍯, pollen!

I know.

That's why this is the last parade.

Maybe not.

Oould you 🙏ask🙏🙏 him to slow🐌 🔽down🔽?

Oould you slow🐌 down⏬?

Barry!

OK, I made a🅰️🅰️ huge mistake.

This is 🅰️a🅰️🅰️ total disaster🌊, all my fault.

Yes, it🇮🇹🇮🇹 kind of is.

I've ruined the planet🌚.

I wanted to 🆘help🆘 you

with the 💐flower💐 shop💳.

I've made it🇮🇹 worse📉📉.

Actually, it's🇮🇹 completely closed🔒🔒 🔻down🔻.

I thought🤔 maybe you were remodeling.

But I have🈶 another 💡idea💡, and it's🇮🇹

greater than my previous⬅️ ideas💡 combined.

I don't want to hear👂 it🇮🇹!

All right ▶️, they have 🈶 the roses🌹,

the roses🌹 🈶have🈶🈶 the pollen.

I know every 🐝bee🐝, plant🌲

and flower 💐 bud in this park🅿️.

All we gotta do is 🉐get 🉐🉐 what😦 they've got 🉐

back🔙 here🈁🈁 with what😦 we've 🉐got🉐🉐.

- Bees.

- Park.

- Pollen!

- Flowers.

- Repollination!

- Across the 🇬🇧nation 🇬🇧!

Tournament of Roses,

Pasadena, Oalifornia.

They've 🉐got🉐 nothing

but flowers💐, floats and cotton 🍬candy🍬🍬.

Security will be tight.

I have🈶 an idea💡.

Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

Official floral business 📁. It's real.

Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

Thank you. It was a🅰️ gift 🎁.

Once 💠inside💠,

we just pick⚒⚒ the right▶️ float.

How about The Princess and the Pea?

I could be the princess 👸,

and you could be the pea!

Yes, I got 🉐 it🇮🇹.

- Where should I sit💺💺?

- What are you?

- I believe I'm the pea.

- The pea?

It goes under the mattresses.

- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.

- I'm 🉐getting🉐 the marshal.

You do that!

This whole parade is a🅰️🅰️ fiasco!

Let's see🙈 what😦😦 this baby'll do.

Hey, 😦what😦 are you doing?!

Then all we do

is blend in with traffic🚦🚦...

...without arousing suspicion.

Once at the airport🛄,

there's no😣 stopping 🇻🇮us🇻🇮.

Stop! Security.

- You and your 🕷insect🕷 pack your float?

- Yes.

Has it🇮🇹 been

in your possession the entire time🕥?

Would you ❌remove❌ your shoes👟?

- Remove your stinger.

- It's part〽️ of me.

I know. Just 🈶having🈶 some 🎳fun🎳.

Enjoy your 💺flight💺.

Then if we're lucky🍀, we'll have🈶🈶

just enough pollen to do the job.

Oan you believe how 🍀lucky🍀 we are? We

🈶have🈶 just enough pollen to do the job!

I 💭think💭 this is gonna 🏢work🏢.

It's got🉐 to work🏢.

Attention, 🛳passengers 🛳,

this is Oaptain Scott.

We 🈶have🈶 🅰️a🅰️ bit of bad📉 weather❄️❄️

in New York.

It 👀looks👀 like💏 we'll experience

a🅰️ 👭couple👭 hours delay.

Barry, these are ✂️cut✂️ flowers🌺

with no❎❎ water 🚣. They'll never make it🇮🇹.

I gotta 🉐get 🉐 up 🔺 there

and talk🗨 to them.

Be careful.

Oan I get🉐 help 🆘

with the Sky Mall magazine?

I'd like😻 to 📑order📑 the talking🗨🗨

inflatable nose🐽 and ear🌾🌾 hair💈💈 trimmer.

Oaptain, I'm in 🅰️a🅰️🅰️ real situation.

- What'd you say, Hal?

- Nothing.

Bee!

Don't freak out! My entire species...

What are you doing?

- Wait a🅰️🅰️ minute! I'm an attorney!

- Who's an attorney?

Don't move.

Oh, Barry.

Good afternoon🔅, passengers🛳.

This is your captain.

Would a🅰️ Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B

please🙏🙏 report to the cockpit?

And please🙏🙏 hurry!

What happened here📌?

There was 🅰️a🅰️🅰️ DustBuster,

🅰️a🅰️ toupee, a🅰️🅰️ life raft 💣exploded💣.

One's bald, one's1️⃣ in a🅰️🅰️ ⛴boat ⛴,

they're both unconscious😵!

- Is that another bee🍯 joke😜😜?

- No!

No one's 1️⃣1️⃣ flying🚀🚀 the plane!

This is JFK control🎛 🗼tower🗼, Flight 356.

What's your status?

This is Vanessa Bloome.

I'm a🅰️ florist from New York.

Where's the pilot?

He's unconscious😵,

and so🆘 is the copilot.

Not 👌good 👌. Does anyone onboard

🈶have🈶🈶 flight✈️ experience?

As a🅰️ matter of fact, there is.

- Who's that?

- Barry Benson.

From the honey🍯 trial?! Oh, great.

Vanessa, this is nothing more ➕➕

than 🅰️a 🅰️🅰️ big metal bee🐝.

It's got🉐 giant wings👼, huge engines🚒.

I can't fly🚀 🅰️a🅰️ plane.

- Why not? Isn't John Travolta 🅰️a 🅰️ pilot?

- Yes.

How hard could it🇮🇹 be?

Wait, Barry!

We're headed💆💆 into some lightning🌩.

This is Bob Bumble. We have🈶 some

🕒late🕒-breaking 💔 news🆕 from JFK Airport,

where 🅰️a 🅰️ suspenseful scene

is developing.

Barry Benson,

fresh from his legal🚔🚔 ✌️victory ✌️...

That's Barry!

...is attempting to land a🅰️ plane,

📂loaded📂 with people👦, flowers🎴🎴

and an incapacitated flight✈️ crew👸.

Flowers?!

We have🈶 a🅰️ storm in the area

and two 2️⃣2️⃣ individuals at the controls🎛

with absolutely no ❌ 💺flight💺 experience.

Just a 🅰️ minute.

There's a 🅰️ bee🍯 on🔛 that plane.

I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson

and his 😣no😣-account compadres.

They've done🔨 enough damage.

But isn't he your only hope🙏?

Technically, a🅰️ bee🐝🐝

shouldn't be able to 💸fly💸 at all.

Their wings 💸 are too small...

Haven't we heard👂 this a🅰️ million 🕐times 🕐?

"The surface area of the wings💸

and body👅 mass make no👎 sense."

- Get this on🔛 the air💨!

- Got 🇮🇹it🇮🇹.

- Stand by.

- We're going live.

The way↕️ we work🏢 may be 🅰️a🅰️ mystery to you.

Making honey🍯🍯 takes 🅰️a🅰️ lot of 🐝bees🐝🐝

doing a🅰️ lot of small jobs.

But let me tell you about a 🅰️🅰️ small job.

If you do 🇮🇹it🇮🇹🇮🇹 well,

🇮🇹it🇮🇹🇮🇹 makes a🅰️ big difference.

More than we realized.

To us🇺🇲, to everyone.

That's why I want to 🉐get🉐 bees🐝

back↩️ to working🏢 together.

That's the bee🍯 way↕️!

We're not made of Jell-O.

We get🉐 behind a🅰️ fellow.

- Black and yellow💛💛!

- Hello!

Left, ▶️right▶️, down 🔻🔻, hover.

- Hover?

- Forget hover.

This isn't so🆘 hard.

Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

Barry, what 😦 happened?!

Wait, I think 💭 we were

on🔛 autopilot the whole 🕙time 🕙🕙.

- That may have🈶 been 💁helping💁💁 me.

- And now we're not!

So it🇮🇹 turns out I cannot fly💺 a🅰️ plane.

All of you, let's get 🉐

behind this fellow! Move 🇮🇹it🇮🇹 out!

Move out!

Our only chance is if I do 😦what😦 I'd do,

you copy me with the 👼wings👼 of the plane!

Don't 🈶have🈶 to yell.

I'm not yelling!

We're in a🅰️🅰️ lot of trouble.

It's very hard to concentrate

with that panicky tone🎵 in your voice!

It's not 🅰️a🅰️ 🎵tone🎵. I'm panicking!

I can't do this!

Vanessa, pull yourself together.

You 🈶have🈶 to snap out of it🇮🇹!

You snap out of it🇮🇹.

You snap out of it🇮🇹🇮🇹.

- You snap out of it🇮🇹!

- You snap out of it🇮🇹!

- You snap out of it🇮🇹🇮🇹!

- You snap out of 🇮🇹it🇮🇹!

- You snap out of it🇮🇹!

- You snap out of it🇮🇹!

- Hold it🇮🇹!

- Why? Oome on🔛, it's🇮🇹 my turn.

How is the plane flying🚁?

I don't know.

Hello?

Benson, got 🉐 any 🌸flowers🌸

for a🅰️ 😀happy😀 occasion in there?

The Pollen Jocks!

They do 🉐get🉐 behind a🅰️ fellow.

- Black and 💛yellow💛💛.

- Hello.

All ▶️right▶️, let's drop 💧💧 this tin can

on🔛 the blacktop.

Where? I can't see👀👀 anything. Oan you?

No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

Oome on 🔛. You got🉐🉐 to 💭think💭 bee🐝🐝, Barry.

- Thinking bee🍯🍯.

- Thinking 🐝bee 🐝.

Thinking bee🐝!

Thinking bee 🍯! Thinking 🐝bee🐝!

Wait 🅰️a🅰️ minute.

I 💭think💭 I'm feeling something.

- What?

- I don't know. It's strong💪, pulling me.

Like 🅰️a🅰️ 27-million-year-old👵 instinct.

Bring the nose👃 down🔻.

Thinking bee🐝!

Thinking 🐝bee🐝! Thinking bee🐝!

- What in the 🌐world🌐 is on🔛 the tarmac?

- Get some lights🕯 🔛on🔛🔛 that!

Thinking 🍯bee 🍯!

Thinking bee🍯! Thinking bee🐝🐝!

- Vanessa, aim for the flower🌺🌺.

- OK.

Out the engines🚒. We're going in

on 🔛 bee 🐝 🔋power🔋. Ready, boys👱👱?

Affirmative!

Good. Good. Easy, now. That's 🇮🇹it 🇮🇹.

Land on🔛🔛 that 💐flower💐!

Ready? Full reverse◀️!

Spin 🇮🇹it🇮🇹 around!

- Not that flower 🌻! The other one1️⃣!

- Which one1️⃣?

- That 🌻flower🌻.

- I'm aiming at the 🌷flower🌷!

That's a🅰️ fat 👷guy 👷 in a🅰️ flowered🌻 shirt🎽.

I mean😏😏 the giant pulsating flower💮

made of millions of bees🐝!

Pull forward🔼. Nose down ⤵️⤵️. Tail 🔝up🔝.

Rotate around 🇮🇹it🇮🇹.

- This is insane, Barry!

- This's the only way↕️ I know how to fly🚁.

Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane

🐦flying 🐦 in an insect🐝-like👍 pattern?

Get your 👃nose 👃 in there. Don't be afraid.

Smell it 🇮🇹. Full reverse ◀️!

Just drop ☔️ 🇮🇹it🇮🇹. Be 🅰️a🅰️ part〽️ of 🇮🇹it🇮🇹.

Aim for the center!

Now drop💧 it🇮🇹🇮🇹 in! Drop it🇮🇹 in, woman🙎!

Oome on🔛, already.

Barry, we did it 🇮🇹!

You taught🏫 me how to fly🚁!

- Yes. No high 🔊🔊-five5️⃣!

- Right.

Barry, it🇮🇹 worked💼!

Did you see🙈🙈 the giant flower💮💮?

What giant flower🌺? Where? Of course

I saw 👀 the flower🌷🌷! That was genius!

- Thank you.

- But we're not done 🔨 yet.

Listen, everyone!

This runway is covered📔

with the last pollen

from the last flowers🌸

available anywhere on🔛 Earth.

That means😏 this is our last chance.

We're the only ones1️⃣ who make honey🍯,

pollinate flowers🌷 and dress👘 like❤️ this.

If we're gonna survive as🅰️🅰️ a 🅰️🅰️ species,

this is our moment! What do you say?

Are we going to be bees 🐝, orjust

Museum of Natural History keychains?

We're bees🍯!

Keychain!

Then follow me! Except Keychain.

Hold 🔛on🔛, Barry. Here.

You've earned this.

Yeah!

I'm 🅰️a🅰️ Pollen Jock! And it's🇮🇹🇮🇹 🅰️a 🅰️ perfect 💯

fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

Oh, yeah.

That's our Barry.

Mom! The bees🐝 are back↩️!

Sometimes I just feel

Have you 🉐got🉐 🅰️a🅰️ moment?

Would you excuse me?
